# Get started

## Why

The goal of the project is to explore machine learning using python and some of the popular machine learning libraries. The project takes inspiration from a machine leanring course taught using matlab, so the assigments are based on the course itself and translated into python. The results are collected and verfied against the matlab counterpart
